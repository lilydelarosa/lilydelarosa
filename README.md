## Hi!👋 I'm Lily

I’m a Full Stack Developer in training with a strong interest in Front-End development, UI solutions, and creating smooth, intuitive user experiences. 
I originally began my journey during the pandemic by self-teaching UX/UI design, which opened the door to the larger tech world. After earning my UX/UI certification, I discovered my passion for coding and continued learning consistently in my free time until I was able to formally enroll in college without disrupting my daily responsibilities. Now I’m focused on sharpening my front-end fundamentals and building real-world projects, growing into a Software Engineer role

**“Ew, a bug 🐛”**

### What I'm currently working on:
- Personal projects to strengthen my front-end + full-stack skills.
- Codecademy’s Front-End Development coursework to refresh and strengthen my fundamentals. 
- API integration & best practices.

### What I want to collaborate on:
- Front-end UI builds, open-source beginner-friendly projects, and real-world mini apps, but I’m open to collaborating on anything that allows mutual learning and growth. I love expanding my knowledge and exploring new areas in tech.

### Certifications:
- Full-Stack Development @ LACC
- UX/UI Certification @ Codecademy
- HTML & CSS @ FreeCodeCamp & CodeCademy
- JavaScript @ Codecademy
- Front End Development @ Codecademy (Pending)
