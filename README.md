## Hi there 👋 I'm Lily

I’m a Full Stack Developer in training with a strong interest in Front-End, UI, and building clean user experiences. Currently leveling up my JavaScript, React, and backend fundamentals while working toward applying for software roles.

**“Build. Break. Learn. Repeat.”**

### What I'm currently working on:
- Personal projects to strengthen my front-end + full stack skills  
- Practicing version control workflow and Git/GitHub collaboration

### What I'm currently learning:
- Advanced JS concepts  
- React ecosystem  
- API integration & best practices  

### What I want to collaborate on:
- Front-end UI builds, open-source beginner friendly projects, and real world mini apps

### Fun fact:
- I originally started in UX/UI design which led me deeper into coding — now I’m all in.
